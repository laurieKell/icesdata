# icesdata

Comprehensive package for ICES age-structured stock assessment data, including utility functions for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Installation

### From GitHub

```r
# Install devtools if needed
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# Install from GitHub
devtools::install_github("lauriekell/icesdata")
```

### From Local Source

```r
# Install from local source
devtools::install("path/to/icesdata")
```

## Features

- **FLR method extensions** for ebiomass, benchmark, fishlife, eqsim, and kobe indicators
- **Generic function definitions** for ICES stock assessment utilities
- **Methods for FLStock, FLStocks, and FLBRP objects**

## Core Functions (with methods implemented)

- `ebiomass` - Methods for FLStock and FLBRP
- `benchmark` - Methods for FLStock, FLStocks, and FLBRP  
- `fishlife` - Methods for FLStock and FLStocks
- `eqsim` - Methods for FLStock and FLStocks
- `FLifePar` - Methods for FLStock and FLStocks
- `kobe` - Methods for FLStock and FLBRP

## Usage

```r
library(icesdata)

# Use FLR methods on stock objects
ebiomass_result <- ebiomass(stock_object)
benchmark_result <- benchmark(stock_object)
kobe_indicators <- kobe(stock_object)
```

## Data

The package includes ICES stock assessment data:

```r
# Load core data using standard R data() function (recommended)
library(icesdata)
data(icesdata)  # Main ICES stock data (FLStocks object)
data(info)      # Stock metadata
data(spp)       # Species information

# Or use helper functions (also works with subfolder structure)
load_all_ices_data()  # Loads all input data
load_ices_stocks()    # Loads icesdata
load_ices_metadata()  # Loads info and spp
```

**Note:** Data files are available both in the root `data/` directory (for standard `data()` access) and organized in subdirectories (`data/stocks/` and `data/metadata/`) for documentation purposes.

Output data files (generated by vignettes) are stored in `vignettes/data/` and are not tracked in git. See individual vignettes for details.

## Dependencies

- FLCore (for FLR functionality)
- methods, stats, utils (base R)
